					Advance Rulings provide foreign investors with the certainty of knowing their customs duty
					liabilities for proposed imports into India and exports from India, in advance.
					<br><br>
					The Advance Ruling scheme allows various categories of entities to seek clarity on their customs
					obligations. This includes non-resident investors establishing joint ventures in India with either a resident or
					another non-resident; residents setting up joint ventures with non-residents; wholly owned Indian
					subsidiaries of foreign companies; joint ventures in India; or any other class or category of
					persons as notified by the Government of India. These entities can request a ruling in advance
					from the Authority for Advance Rulings. Importantly, once issued, these rulings are final and
					cannot be appealed by either the applicant or the authorities under Central Excise, Customs, or Service Tax laws.

					The primary objective behind the establishment of the Settlement Commission (referred to hereafter
					as the Commission) is to provide a mechanism for the swift resolution of tax disputes in a
					conciliatory manner, rather than through prolonged, adversarial litigation. The Commission is not
					intended to offer a loophole for tax evaders; rather, it is designed to ensure a fair and balanced
					resolution of tax issues, thereby avoiding lengthy litigation that benefits neither the tax
					department nor the members of the trade and industry. In proceedings before the Commission,
					there are no adversaries, only parties seeking settlement.
					<br><br>
					Any taxpayer may submit an application in the prescribed form and manner, containing a full and
					true disclosure of any unpaid duty liability that has not been previously reported to the relevant
					authorities. This disclosure should include the basis for determining the liability, the additional
					amount of Customs, Excise Duty, or Service Tax the taxpayer acknowledges as payable, as well as
					details of the excisable goods, imported or exported goods, or taxable services for which there was
					a short levy.
					<br><br>
					The Settlement Commission holds the authority to grant immunity from prosecution for offences under
					the Central Excise Act, the Customs Act, the Indian Penal Code, or any other relevant Central Act,
					with respect to matters covered by the settlement.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, the Commission has the power to grant partial or full immunity from the imposition
					of penalties or fines under the Central Excise Act or the Customs Act, depending on the case under
					consideration.
					<br><br>
					The proceedings before the Settlement Commission are treated as judicial proceedings within the
					meaning of Sections 193 and 228, and for the purposes of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code.
